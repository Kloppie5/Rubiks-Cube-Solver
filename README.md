# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

6 90 degree rotations.

orbits of size 24, matching the root orientations of the cube

base pieces subgroup of index 3 in the wreath product of a cyclic 3 with S(8) -> no total freedom
one corner clockwise -> one corner counterclockwise

semidirect product of a 2^11 with an S(12), namely a subgroup of index 2 of the wreath product of a cyclic 2 with S(12) -> no total freedom
flip two edges

direct product of groups is strictly super -> not independent
exchange 2 in both groups
